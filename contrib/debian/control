Description: peer-to-peer network based demurrage currency - daemon
 Xcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.  Xcoin features built-in demurrage to
 encourage long-term thinking, low interest rates, and a high velocity
 of money.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.

 This package provides xd, a combined daemon and CLI tool to
 interact with the daemon.
